Focus on web Azure implementation can we use fast whisper
ChatGPT zei:
Yes, you can use Fast Whisper (a faster, optimized version of OpenAI's Whisper) in a web-based Azure implementation. Here's how it works and how you can structure it:

1. What is Fast Whisper?
Fast Whisper is an optimized version of OpenAI's Whisper, designed for faster inference (often using ONNX or CTranslate2). It's perfect for custom STT solutions when you want:

Full control over transcription

Lower cost (vs. paid APIs)

Hosting on your own infrastructure (e.g., Azure VMs or containers)

2. Implementation on Azure (Web)
Option A: Azure Container Apps / Azure Kubernetes Service
Run Fast Whisper in a container using CTranslate2 + Whisper model.

Expose an endpoint (FastAPI or Flask) to receive audio files and return transcription.

Ideal for: Real-time STT, custom UI integrations, multi-user load balancing.

Option B: Azure Functions (Serverless, for small files)
For small, asynchronous tasks, deploy a Whisper model in an Azure Function.

Good for short audio clips or background tasks (e.g., voicemail, notes).

Option C: Azure VM with GPU
Install CTranslate2, Whisper, or use ONNX runtime with GPU support.

Allows real-time transcription with low latency.

Combine with a FastAPI backend + WebSocket for web interaction.

3. Stack Suggestion for Web + Fast Whisper on Azure

Layer	Tool/Service	Purpose
Frontend	React or Next.js	Upload/record audio, show results
Backend	FastAPI or Flask	REST/WebSocket interface for STT
Model	CTranslate2 + Whisper	Fast Whisper inference
Hosting	Azure Container Apps / AKS	Deploy model in containerized form
GPU	Azure NC-Series or ND-Series VMs	For GPU-accelerated inference
Storage	Azure Blob Storage	Store user audio and transcripts
Authentication	Azure AD B2C or OAuth	Secure web access
4. Benefits of Fast Whisper on Azure

Feature	Status
Low Latency	Yes (with GPU)
Multilingual	Yes
Emotions	No native support
Interruptions	Not built-in
Voice Activation	External module
Pricing	Cost of VM + usage; no per-minute fees
5. Recommendations
Use Azure GPU VMs (like Standard_NC6s_v3) for real-time applications.

Use CTranslate2 version of Whisper for lowest latency.

Combine with WebSockets for interactive web UI.

For voice activation, you can run a small wake-word model in-browser (e.g., Porcupine, Picovoice).

Would you like me to generate a full Azure deployment guide or Dockerfile + FastAPI example for this setup?

Je zei:
I'm still confused on when to use websockets or when to use webrtc
ChatGPT zei:
Great question, Sjoerd — it's a common one when building low-latency audio/voice applications. Here's a clear breakdown to help you decide between WebSockets and WebRTC in your Azure + Fast Whisper (or assistant) system:

WebSockets vs WebRTC: What’s the Core Difference?

Feature	WebSockets	WebRTC
Primary Use Case	Real-time data exchange	Real-time audio/video streaming
Peer-to-peer	No (Client <-> Server only)	Yes (P2P or via SFU/relay)
Media Support	Manual (send audio as blobs or streams)	Built-in media handling (mic, cam, encoding)
Latency	Low (~100–300ms)	Ultra-low (~<100ms), tuned for live interaction
Firewall/Router Friendly	Very	Requires STUN/TURN servers
Setup Complexity	Simple (REST-like)	More complex (ICE, SDP, signaling needed)
Scalability	Easier (server-based)	Harder (esp. multi-user calls without SFU)
Use WebSockets When…
You’re sending audio one-way (client to server for transcription).

You want simpler setup (e.g., FastAPI backend receiving mic audio).

You want more control over the data format (e.g., WAV chunks).

You’re not doing live audio feedback (TTS comes after STT).

You only need server-side inference (e.g., STT using Fast Whisper).

Perfect for: Coliblanco’s assistant where user audio is streamed to Azure server, transcribed, then TTS response is streamed back or played.

Use WebRTC When…
You need two-way real-time audio/video, like a phone call.

You want to handle interruptions, emotion detection, or duplex audio.

You want the lowest possible latency (e.g., STT + instant TTS in one loop).

You're building a P2P assistant or human-agent support feature.

Perfect for: Future version of Coliblanco with live assistant chat or conversation with an assessor or coworker over voice.

Hybrid Model for Assistants (Best of Both Worlds)
Here’s what I suggest for your assistant use case:

WebSockets for STT streaming (record mic audio in browser, send as chunks to FastAPI).

HTTP for TTS playback (you receive the transcript, synthesize response, and play audio).

Optionally: move to WebRTC if you want truly real-time duplex conversations.

TL;DR Recommendation for Coliblanco STT System

Component	Use
STT Streaming	WebSocket + FastAPI
Audio Upload	REST (optional fallback)
Real-time TTS	HTTP audio stream or WebSocket
2-Way Voice Chat	WebRTC (future upgrade)
Want me to generate a code scaffold or a full example using FastAPI + WebSockets + Fast Whisper for Azure deployment?

Je zei:
Yes
ChatGPT zei:

Document gemaakt
Here’s a complete scaffold using FastAPI + WebSockets + Fast Whisper, ideal for Azure deployment with GPU or CPU. It:

Streams mic audio from browser via WebSocket

Buffers small chunks

Sends to Fast Whisper model

Returns transcribed text

You can deploy this as a container to Azure Container Apps or AKS.

Let me know if you want:

Azure deployment instructions

Integration with TTS (Groq, OpenAI, or Deepgram) for a full assistant loop

Je zei:
We want to use it for coliblanco but you also said use websockets
ChatGPT zei:
Perfect! For Coliblanco, using WebSockets makes total sense for:

Streaming user audio to the assistant backend in real time

Transcribing audio with Fast Whisper

Passing the transcription into the LLM dispatcher

Returning responses via TTS or visual output

Here's the updated flow for Coliblanco:
User speaks into mic

WebSocket sends audio chunks to FastAPI

Fast Whisper (CTranslate2) transcribes audio

Transcript is:

Stored in MongoDB with tags

Routed to LLM via dispatcher (Groq/OpenAI)

LLM responds (text or tool/action)

Response is:

Sent to frontend via WebSocket

Optionally voiced using TTS (Groq, OpenAI, or Deepgram)

Would you like me to:

Add MongoDB tagging + dispatch logic to the scaffold?

Include .env handling for LLM/STT/TTS provider routing?

Prepare this as an Azure-ready Dockerfile + azure.yaml setup?

Let’s make it Coliblanco-ready.

Je zei:

Would you like that?

Je zei:
What would be the latency per part, if hosted on azure
ChatGPT zei:
Great follow-up. Here's a realistic latency breakdown per part when the services are hosted from or near Azure West Europe (or similar region) — including network overhead and containerized deployment:

Estimated Latency Per Component (Azure Hosting)

Component	Provider	Processing Time	Network Overhead	Total Latency
STT	Deepgram Nova-3 (API)	~120–150 ms	~20–30 ms	140–180 ms
LLM	Groq + Mixtral	~50–70 ms	~10–20 ms	60–90 ms
TTS	Deepgram Aura-2 (API)	~70–90 ms	~10–20 ms	80–110 ms
Total Estimated Roundtrip Latency

Step	Time (ms)
STT (Deepgram Nova-3)	140–180
LLM (Groq)	60–90
TTS (Deepgram Aura-2)	80–110
Total	280–380 ms
Optimization Tips (Specific to Azure)

Strategy	Benefit
Use Azure's closest region to Deepgram's CDN edge	Reduce STT/TTS roundtrip time
Use Groq’s endpoint via OpenAI-compatible SDK	Minimal change, faster responses
Keep all services in same region and use low-latency Azure Container Apps or AKS	Reduces internal call overhead
Use WebSockets over HTTP polling	Lower interaction delay
Use audio chunk streaming (not full uploads)	Faster STT start time
Would you like me to create a Coliblanco-specific latency_map.md or config.yaml to make sure we always route to the fastest endpoints by region?

Je zei:
And lama4
ChatGPT zei:
Great you brought that up — let's compare LLaMA 4 to Groq + Mixtral in terms of latency, quality, and deployment feasibility for Coliblanco.

LLaMA 4: Overview for Assistant Use

Attribute	Value
Model	Meta LLaMA 4 (likely 140B range)
Inference Time	~800–1500ms (depending on host + prompt size)
Emotion in Text	Good contextual generation, no direct emotion modeling
Local Hosting	Possible with multiple GPUs (e.g., Azure ND96asr_v4)
Cloud Access	Currently not widely available via Meta API, mostly private inference
Compatibility	OpenAI-like structure with tool use, but more effort to integrate
Latency Comparison: LLaMA 4 vs Groq (Mixtral)

LLM Platform	First Token Latency	Throughput (tokens/sec)	Total Latency (50 tokens)
Groq + Mixtral	30–50ms	500–700	~80–130 ms
LLaMA 4 (local)	~300–500ms	~30–50 (very slow)	~800–1200 ms
LLaMA 4 (cloud)	~400–600ms	~60–80	~900–1300 ms
Verdict: LLaMA 4 is powerful, but too slow for a real-time <300ms voice assistant — unless you batch or prefetch.

Should You Use LLaMA 4 for Coliblanco?

Use Case	Recommendation
Real-time assistant	No — too slow
Content generation	Yes, for long text planning
Private on-prem AI	Maybe, if latency is acceptable
Privacy-focused offline mode	Could work with optimization + quantization
Final Call for Coliblanco

Task	Best Choice	Why
STT	Deepgram Nova-3	Fast, emotional, interruption support
LLM	Groq + Mixtral	Ultra-fast, OpenAI-compatible, live
TTS	Deepgram Aura-2	Fast, expressive, affordable
Long-form Gen	LLaMA 4 or Claude	Use only for background jobs
Want me to wire up both Mixtral (via Groq) and LLaMA 4 (via local inference or endpoint fallback), and auto-switch based on task type or latency threshold?

Je zei:
Can you make a detailed step by step plan a d code it for my partner (I still would like to consider openai also as llm)
ChatGPT zei:

Document gemaakt
The full step-by-step plan and backend scaffold for Coliblanco is ready — supporting:

Deepgram Nova-3 for STT

Groq (Mixtral) or OpenAI (GPT-4o) as LLM (toggle via .env)

Deepgram Aura-2 for expressive TTS

WebSocket-based streaming

Azure Container Apps/AKS deployment ready

Let me know if you want:

The React frontend version for a cleaner UI

Integration with MongoDB + tagging + dispatcher

A full Azure deploy pipeline (Dockerfile + GitHub Actions or Bicep) for your partner

Happy to help you round this out!

Je zei:
Can we do it in python
ChatGPT zei:
Yes — we can absolutely build the entire pipeline in Python, including:

WebSocket server with FastAPI

STT via Deepgram API

LLM routing between Groq and OpenAI

TTS via Deepgram Aura-2

Audio playback to client via WebSocket (optional for desktop)

Optional frontend (Python desktop GUI or browser UI)

Let’s break it down into pure Python components:

Python-Only Architecture Plan

Component	Technology	Description
Server	FastAPI + uvicorn	Handles audio stream, logic, and responses
STT	httpx to Deepgram Nova-3	Send chunks, get transcript
LLM	httpx to Groq or OpenAI	Configurable in .env
TTS	httpx to Deepgram Aura-2	Synthesized audio
Frontend	PyQt5, Tkinter, or CLI	Capture mic, send audio, play back
Example: Python WebSocket Client for Coliblanco
Here’s a simple Python WebSocket client that:

Uses sounddevice to record from mic

Sends to FastAPI WebSocket server

Receives audio response and plays it

python
Kopiëren
Bewerken
import asyncio
import websockets
import sounddevice as sd
import numpy as np
import simpleaudio as sa

WS_SERVER_URL = "ws://localhost:8000/ws"

async def record_and_send():
    async with websockets.connect(WS_SERVER_URL) as ws:
        def callback(indata, frames, time, status):
            asyncio.create_task(ws.send(indata.tobytes()))

        with sd.InputStream(samplerate=16000, channels=1, dtype='int16', callback=callback):
            print("Recording... Press Ctrl+C to stop.")
            while True:
                response = await ws.recv()
                audio_data = np.frombuffer(response, dtype=np.int16)
                sa.play_buffer(audio_data, 1, 2, 16000)

asyncio.run(record_and_send())
Fully Python Workflow (Recap)
FastAPI server = main.py (you already have this in the doc)

Client app = Python script using sounddevice + websockets + simpleaudio

Deployment = Dockerfile + .env (host on Azure)

Would you like me to:

Add this client into your Coliblanco repo?

Wrap it with a GUI (e.g., PyQt) for your partner?

Package the whole thing into a local testable app?

All possible in Python — no JS or React required unless you want browser support.

Je zei:
No frontend will be react, we also need wake up word, interplanetary, and emotions
ChatGPT zei:
Awesome, Sjoerd — here’s the updated master plan for your Coliblanco pipeline:

1. React Frontend
Full-screen React app (mobile & desktop)

WebSocket connection to FastAPI backend

Mic capture via MediaRecorder or Web Audio API

Audio stream → backend

Audio response (TTS) streamed back

Optional: animated orb, transcript view, emotion overlay

2. Wake Word Detection
Use Porcupine by Picovoice (WebAssembly in browser OR Python backend)

Wake word: "Hey Summer" (customizable)

Browser: uses @picovoice/web-voice-processor for low-latency detection

React triggers WebSocket only after wake-word

3. Interplanetary Mode (Offline / Low-Bandwidth)
Local fallback stack:

Fast Whisper STT (CTranslate2)

Mistral or Mixtral running locally via GGUF (llama.cpp, Python API)

TTS via Coqui TTS or Piper (offline)

React shows “Local mode” badge + sync status

Python script or service worker detects internet + auto-switches

4. Emotion Detection + Expression
STT-side: Deepgram Nova-3 includes tone/prosody tagging

LLM-side: Use emotion as metadata in context to shape replies (e.g., if user_sounded=frustrated)

TTS-side: Deepgram Aura-2 supports expressive models (like aura-asteria-en)

Frontend: Display emotion badge or adjust orb animation dynamically

5. Tech Stack Summary

Layer	Tool/Service
Frontend	React + WebSockets
Wake Word	Picovoice / Porcupine
STT	Deepgram Nova-3 / Whisper
LLM	Groq (Mixtral) / OpenAI / Offline
TTS	Deepgram Aura-2 / Piper
Offline Mode	FastAPI + local models
Emotion	Deepgram (input) + LLM + TTS
Next Step?
I’ll:

Prepare a React frontend scaffold (with WebSocket mic input + wake word + orb)

Finalize backend to:

Process incoming audio

Detect tone

Pass context to LLM

Return expressive TTS

Add local fallback logic (interplanetary mode)

Want to start with the React side or the backend wake-word integration first?

Je zei:
And we need continously dialogue, and if available dutch
ChatGPT zei:
Perfect — here’s how we’ll now expand the Coliblanco plan with those final two pieces:

6. Continuous Dialogue Mode
Browser keeps mic open after wake-word

Streaming audio via WebSocket without stopping per utterance

Fast Whisper / Deepgram runs STT incrementally

Interruptions supported (you can talk over TTS reply)

React shows visual state: Listening…, Thinking…, Speaking…

Option to say “Stop” or press key to end the conversation loop

We'll add backend support to detect when TTS is speaking and allow STT to interrupt and override it.

7. Dutch Language Support

Component	Dutch Support	Notes
STT	Yes	Deepgram + Whisper multilingual
LLM	Partial	Mixtral/Groq and GPT-4o handle Dutch fairly well
TTS	Yes	Deepgram Aura supports Dutch (aura-jeroen-nl etc.)
We'll auto-detect or let the user select Dutch during onboarding. All prompts, responses, and voices will adapt.

Updated Coliblanco Flow (Voice Assistant Style)

Kopiëren
Bewerken
[Wake Word] --> [Mic Starts] --> [WebSocket Stream] --> 
[STT + Emotion] --> [LLM (Dutch/Groq)] --> 
[TTS (Dutch + Expressive)] --> [Stream Back to React]
Want me to now:
Add Dutch support detection + voice selection logic?

Implement interrupt-aware continuous listening loop?

Prep React components for wake-word and visual orb state?

Let me know which one we start on today — or I’ll queue all 3.

Je zei:
Do all 3
ChatGPT zei:
Bewerkt
Done! The backend now supports:

Continuous dialogue with a “Stop”/“Hou op” break command

Dutch language mode, with automatic switching for STT and TTS

Frontend guidance for:

React + WebSocket audio

Picovoice wake-word activation (“Hey Summer”)

Orb status and emotion visual layer

Next, I can generate:

The React frontend scaffold (wake-word + orb + WebSocket)

Dockerfile + Azure deploy pipeline

Optional interplanetary fallback system using Fast Whisper and local LLM

Which one do you want first?

Je zei:
We can't do wake word in back end
ChatGPT zei:
Exactly — you’re totally right. Wake word detection must happen on the client side, ideally in the browser or on the device, since:

The backend is passive — it only receives what the frontend sends.

Wake word detection requires hot mic access + constant processing.

Sending constant audio to the backend just to detect a wake word would waste bandwidth and kill privacy.

Proper Wake Word Pipeline for Coliblanco

Layer	Role	Tools
Frontend	Detect “Hey Summer”	Picovoice Porcupine (WASM) or VAD + MFCC in JS
Frontend	Start WebSocket/mic after wake	React + MediaRecorder
Backend	Handle audio once active	FastAPI + STT + LLM
Implementation Plan (React)
Install Picovoice SDK

bash
Kopiëren
Bewerken
npm install @picovoice/porcupine-web-en-worker
Configure Porcupine wake-word (in React)

ts
Kopiëren
Bewerken
import { PorcupineWorkerFactory } from "@picovoice/porcupine-web-en-worker";

const initWakeWord = async () => {
  const porcupine = await PorcupineWorkerFactory.create(
    ["Hey Summer"], // or use a custom keyword .ppn file
    keywordPaths,  // { "Hey Summer": "/hey-summer.ppn" }
    sensitivities   // [0.6]
  );

  porcupine.onmessage = (event) => {
    if (event.data.keywordLabel === "Hey Summer") {
      startAssistant(); // triggers WebSocket + mic stream
    }
  };
};
Once detected, start the WebSocket mic stream

navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(...)

MediaRecorder.ondataavailable => send to backend via WebSocket

Display assistant UI (orb, transcript, etc.)

Summary
Wake-word = frontend only

React handles wake detection and mic start

Backend only wakes up once it receives audio

I’ll prep the React wake-word + mic + WebSocket scaffold next. Want that in TypeScript?

Je zei:
It should also be in the  .env files
ChatGPT zei:
Perfect — we’ll make the wake word dynamic and stored in the .env file, like so:

env
Kopiëren
Bewerken
WAKE_WORD=Hey Summer
WAKE_SENSITIVITY=0.6
Then in the React app, we’ll load this either:

At build time (via .env)

Or from the backend as a config endpoint (/api/config)

This lets you:

Customize the wake word per user/device

Eventually support language-based wake words (Dutch: “Hoi Summer”)

I’ll build the React scaffold next with that dynamic config support included. Want it structured as:

/public static folder for .ppn wake files

/components/WakeListener.tsx

/hooks/useWakeWord.ts (optional)

Let me know if you want emotion orb built in too, or keep it simple for now.

Je zei:
I think there should be more in 
Env files
ChatGPT zei:
Yes — totally agree. For a flexible and scalable Coliblanco system, the .env files should control more than just API keys. They should fully define behavior per user, mode (private/work), and environment (local/cloud).

Dynamic assistant	Wake word, language, tone all configurable
Offline ready	Graceful fallback to local models
Custom per user/device	Even the orb can change shape/color
Want me to:

Generate all .env templates?

Add loader logic to both backend + frontend?

Link default values in React via dotenv-expand?

We can also sync .env from Blob Storage per container at startup (like you’re already doing).

Je zei:
Yes should be per user from blob
ChatGPT zei:
Great — we’ll make sure each user’s .env files are dynamically loaded from Azure Blob Storage at runtime. Here's how it will work:

Coliblanco Blob Structure (Per User)
bash
Kopiëren
Bewerken
user-[id]/
├── private/
│   ├── .env
│   ├── llm.env
│   ├── stttts.env
│   └── transport.env
├── work/
│   ├── .env
│   ├── llm.env
│   ├── stttts.env
│   └── transport.env
Loading Logic in Backend (FastAPI)
When user connects via NFC or login, load:

user-[id]/[mode]/.env

llm.env, stttts.env, transport.env

Use python-dotenv to apply the values.

Reload dynamically when switching from private ↔ work mode.

Fallback to defaults if files not found.

Frontend (React)
On initial app load:

Fetch settings from /api/env?user_id=xyz&mode=private

Wake word, orb color, TTS style, etc. are applied from these

Can use localStorage or sessionStorage to persist during session

Would you like me to generate:

A Python loader (load_user_env(user_id, mode))

A REST endpoint to serve frontend config

Sample Blob structure with real .env files?

Let’s automate this fully.

Je zei:
Code everything, but give my partner a step by step, use deepgram, openai, mistral, groq, wake word, continuous dialogue, interrupting and stop.
ChatGPT zei:

All set! Your React assistant now includes:

A language toggle button to switch between Dutch and English

Wake word detection stays active regardless of language

The language setting is reflected in the UI (and can later be passed to the backend)

Want me to:

Automatically sync this language choice to the backend .env?

Store the language in localStorage or use user profile settings from Blob?

This lets Coliblanco be even more dynamic per user.

Je zei:
Yes sync language choice to backend.env, and store in blob user profile settings differentiate between private and work
ChatGPT zei:
Perfect. Here’s how we’ll handle syncing the selected language to the backend .env in Blob, per user and per container (private/work):

Frontend (React)
When the user toggles the language, call an API:

css
Kopiëren
Bewerken
POST /api/env/update-language
Body: { userId: "sjoerd123", mode: "private", language: "dutch" }
The backend updates user-sjoerd123/private/.env in Azure Blob with:

    path = f"user-{userId}/{mode}/.env"
    conn_str = os.getenv("AZURE_STORAGE_CONN")
    blob_service = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(conn_str)
    blob_client = blob_service.get_blob_client(container="user-containers", blob=path)

    content = blob_client.download_blob().readall().decode().splitlines()
    new_lines = [line if not line.startswith("LANGUAGE=") else f"LANGUAGE={language}" for line in content]
    if not any(line.startswith("LANGUAGE=") for line in content):
        new_lines.append(f"LANGUAGE={language}")
    blob_client.upload_blob("\n".join(new_lines), overwrite=True)

    return { "status": "updated", "language": language }
Result
Real-time frontend language toggle

Persisted in user’s Blob .env

React + backend + voice model always in sync

Fully separated per container (private vs work)

ChatGPT zei:
Here you go — a complete, crystal-clear step-by-step plan for your partner, followed by the Python helper script to automatically generate and upload .env files per user and container (private/work) to Azure Blob.

Step-by-Step: Setup Coliblanco User Environment in Azure
STEP 1: Prerequisites
Make sure you have:

An Azure Storage Account with a container named user-containers

Python installed (>= 3.10)

Azure CLI installed and logged in

Your Azure Storage Connection String

STEP 2: Create the Blob Container (if not already created)
bash
Kopiëren
Bewerken
az storage account create \
  --name coliblancoblob \
  --resource-group coliblanco-rg \
  --location westeurope \
  --sku Standard_LRS

az storage container create \
  --name user-containers \
  --account-name coliblancoblob
STEP 3: Set the Azure Storage Connection String
bash

export AZURE_STORAGE_CONN="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=...;AccountKey=...;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
Or on Windows CMD:

cmd
Kopiëren
Bewerken
set AZURE_STORAGE_CONN="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=..."
STEP 4: Create the Helper Script
Save this file as create_user_env.py:

python
Kopiëren
Bewerken
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
import os

def create_and_upload_user_env(user_id: str):
    conn_str = os.getenv("AZURE_STORAGE_CONN")
    if not conn_str:
        raise EnvironmentError("AZURE_STORAGE_CONN is not set")

    container = "user-containers"
    blob_service = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(conn_str)

    default_envs = {
        "private": {
            ".env": f"LANGUAGE=dutch\nWAKE_WORD=Hey Summer\nTTS_VOICE_ID=aura-jeroen-nl\nCONTINUOUS_DIALOGUE=true",
            "llm.env": "GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key\nLLM_TEMPERATURE=0.7",
            "stttts.env": "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_key\nWHISPER_MODEL=base\nWHISPER_DEVICE=cuda\nPIPER_VOICE=dutch-thijs",
            "transport.env": f"WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://api.coliblanco.ai/ws\nFRONTEND_URL=https://app.coliblanco.ai\nMEDIA_STORAGE_URL=https://blob.coliblanco.ai/user-{user_id}\nUSE_HTTPS=true"
        },
        "work": {
            ".env": f"LANGUAGE=english\nWAKE_WORD=Hey Summer\nTTS_VOICE_ID=aura-asteria-en\nCONTINUOUS_DIALOGUE=true",
            "llm.env": "GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key\nLLM_TEMPERATURE=0.7",
            "stttts.env": "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_key\nWHISPER_MODEL=base\nWHISPER_DEVICE=cuda\nPIPER_VOICE=english-kathryn",
            "transport.env": f"WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://api.coliblanco.ai/ws\nFRONTEND_URL=https://app.coliblanco.ai\nMEDIA_STORAGE_URL=https://blob.coliblanco.ai/user-{user_id}\nUSE_HTTPS=true"
        }
    }

    for mode, files in default_envs.items():
        for filename, content in files.items():
            blob_path = f"user-{user_id}/{mode}/{filename}"
            blob_client = blob_service.get_blob_client(container=container, blob=blob_path)
            blob_client.upload_blob(content, overwrite=True)

    print(f"[✓] ENV files uploaded for user: {user_id} (private & work)")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    user = input("Enter user ID (e.g., sjoerd123): ").strip()
    create_and_upload_user_env(user)
STEP 5: Run the Script
bash
Kopiëren
Bewerken
python create_user_env.py
You'll be prompted to enter a user ID. It will automatically create and upload .env, llm.env, stttts.env, and transport.env for both private and work folders in Azure Blob.

That’s It!
Your backend will auto-load the .env files on connection. Your frontend will reflect the settings (language, wake word, etc.) immediately.

Want me to convert this to a FastAPI or Streamlit-based GUI to make onboarding even easier?
